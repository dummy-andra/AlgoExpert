Find Closest Value In BST

You are given a BST data structure consisting of BST nodes.
Each BST node has an integer value stored in a property called "value" and
two children nodes stored in properties called "left" and "right," respectively.

A node is said to be a BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property:
its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left;
its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right;
and both of its children nodes are either BST nodes themselves or None (null) values.
You are also given a target integer value;
write a function that finds the closest value to that target value contained in the BST.

Assume that there will only be one closest value.

Sample input:
             10           , 12
          /      \
        5        15
      /   \    /    \
    2      5  13     22
  /             \
 1               14

Sample output: 13
